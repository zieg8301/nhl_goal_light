##Overview

Nhl goal light python3 for raspberry pi GPIO. Works with any team, just enter team **name without city** when prompted.

Before use, make sure you have:

Python3, python3-pip, mpg123, git

Run the following commands manually to install requirements

run:

  	$ sudo apt-get install git mpg123 python3 python3-pip
    $ sudo git clone https://github.com/arim215/nhl_goal_light.git 
  	$ sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
        
**Always pass through code to read comments and see necessary inputs for your setup!!**

To start application, use following commands:
	
		$ sudo python3 flask_api.py &
		$ sudo python3 nhl_goal_light.py

###Materials

For documentation on how to wire the GPIOs with the lights and the button, pleaser refer to the "docs" folder.

* Raspberry Pi (currently using raspberry pi A model, but any model will work)
* Red Rotating Beacon Warning Light from ebay
* 5V 2 Channel Relay Module from ebay
* Momentary OFF ON Push Round Button
* 12V to 5V 1A adapter (used a car usb adapter) would be good to have a dual usb adapter in case you need to plug something else like a usb speaker.
* 3.5mm audio extension cable

***
###Audio
If you wish to change the audio clips to sounds with your teams goal horn and music, just download them, rename them (goal_horn_#.mp3) and save them in the "audio" folder.

***
##Delay

I've teste my code while watching Rogers Gamecenter Live and the stream seems to be a bit delayed, so I added a delay to my code to make the goal horn start later. You will be prompted to enter a delay that works with your stream.  

***
## TODO
* Test response time after a goal is scored
* Add option to select team thru webpage
* Make code pause between periods
* Allow the addition of a I2C display
* Add a text message service to notify goals and more
